### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who have recently graduated from Lambda School. My goal is to gain a position as a Software Developer which would allow me to fully utilize my current full-stack web development skills. I am most proficient with coding front-end with the React framework, but am always willing to learn new frameworks. Similarly, I am most proficient with Express for building the back-end.
